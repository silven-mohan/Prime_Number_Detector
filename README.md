# Prime_Number_Detector


This is a simple C program that checks whether a given number is a **prime number** or not. It accepts a number from the user and prints a clear message about its status.

## 🛠 Features

- ✔ Checks if the input number is a prime
- ❗ Handles edge case: 1 is neither prime nor composite
- 📘 Uses basic loops and conditionals only
- 🖥 Beginner-friendly, no external libraries required

---

## 📦 How It Works

1. Takes an integer input `n`
2. If `n == 1`, prints it's neither prime nor composite
3. Otherwise, checks divisibility from `2` to `n-1`
4. If no divisor is found → prime, else → not prime

## 💻 Sample Output

```txt
Enter any number: 13
13 is a prime number

Enter any number: 9
9 is not a prime number

Enter any number: 1
1 is neither a prime nor a composite number.
```
